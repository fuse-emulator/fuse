# Building Fuse for Emscripten

Fuse can be built as a single-threaded WebAssembly application using the SDL 2
Widget UI. This target deliberately provides the existing Fuse interface in a
browser canvas; it does not provide browser file pickers, persistent storage,
networking, or a JavaScript control API.

## C11 atomics and threads

Fuse's SDL sound FIFO uses lock-free C11 atomic unsigned integer indices with
acquire/release ordering. Current Emscripten supports these operations without
`-pthread` in a single-threaded build; they do not require shared WebAssembly
memory or a pthread runtime. The FIFO unit tests pass in this configuration
(the pthread stress test is skipped). Fuse's optional network thread is disabled
for this target.

When configured with `--with-fake-glib`, libspectrum uses three `atomic_flag`
objects: one each for the global free lists in `myglib/ghash.c` and
`myglib/gslist.c`, operated on by `atomic_lock()` and `atomic_unlock()` in
`myglib/glock.c`. The only operations are
`atomic_flag_test_and_set_explicit(..., memory_order_acquire)` and
`atomic_flag_clear_explicit(..., memory_order_release)`. The locks make those
global allocators safe if libspectrum is called from multiple native threads;
they do not imply that Fuse needs threads at runtime.

Current Emscripten supports those operations in both configurations. In a
normal single-threaded build Clang lowers them without requiring shared
WebAssembly memory or a pthread runtime. With `-pthread`, it emits operations
for shared memory and adds the worker/pthread runtime. The libspectrum
configure link test checks the exact operations above and succeeds without
`-pthread`. A clean libspectrum and Fuse build also compiles and links without
it. Consequently this target does not use `-pthread`; enabling it would add a
runtime requirement for `SharedArrayBuffer` and cross-origin isolation without
providing a Fuse feature that needs a worker thread.

Do not disable `stdatomic.h` for Emscripten. The historical
`HAVE_STDATOMIC_H && !defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)` workaround is obsolete.

## Tested toolchain

The procedure below was tested with Emscripten 6.0.9-git. Install and activate
that version with emsdk (replace the directory with your preferred location):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk install 6.0.9
./emsdk activate 6.0.9
. ./emsdk_env.sh
```

The commands assume clean, adjacent `libspectrum` and `fuse` source trees.
They use separate build and installation directories so native libraries from
the host cannot satisfy target checks. The explicit
`--host=wasm32-unknown-emscripten` is required so libtool does not configure
itself for the native host. `emconfigure` may nevertheless report
`cross_compiling=no` because configure test programs can execute through Node.

## Build libspectrum

```sh
mkdir -p build/wasm/libspectrum build/wasm/prefix
cd build/wasm/libspectrum

emconfigure ../../../libspectrum/configure \
  --host=wasm32-unknown-emscripten \
  --prefix="$(cd ../prefix && pwd)" \
  --disable-shared --enable-static \
  --with-zlib --without-bzip2 --without-libgcrypt \
  --without-libaudiofile --with-wav-backend=none \
  --with-fake-glib \
  CFLAGS='-O2' LDFLAGS='-sUSE_ZLIB'
emmake make -j4
emmake make install
```

## Build Fuse

From the directory containing the two source trees:

```sh
mkdir -p build/wasm/fuse
cd build/wasm/fuse
PREFIX="$(cd ../prefix && pwd)"

EM_PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig" \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig" \
LIBSPECTRUM_CFLAGS="-I$PREFIX/include" \
LIBSPECTRUM_LIBS="$PREFIX/lib/libspectrum.a" \
SDL2_CFLAGS='-sUSE_SDL=2' \
SDL2_LIBS='-sUSE_SDL=2' \
emconfigure ../../../fuse/configure \
  --host=wasm32-unknown-emscripten \
  --with-sdl --without-x \
  --without-pthread --disable-sockets --without-joystick \
  --with-zlib --without-png --without-libxml2 \
  --disable-desktop-integration \
  CFLAGS='-O2' LDFLAGS='-sUSE_ZLIB'

EM_PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig" \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig" \
emmake make -j4
```

Serve the build directory over HTTP rather than opening the HTML file directly:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/fuse.html`.

The build produces these publication-ready files:

- `fuse.html`
- `fuse.js`
- `fuse.wasm`
- `fuse.data`

`fuse.data` contains the ROMs and UI resources installed by the normal Fuse
build. It contains no demonstration tape and no special configuration file, so
Fuse starts with its ordinary defaults.

## Deliberately disabled facilities

- POSIX threads and sockets: browser networking is outside this milestone, and
  Fuse has no remaining web-target runtime need for a thread.
- Hardware joystick access: browser gamepad integration is not included yet;
  keyboard input remains available.
- libxml2 settings, bzip2 compression, libgcrypt, libaudiofile, libpng, and
  desktop integration: omitted to keep the initial target self-contained and
  free of accidental native dependencies. Zlib remains enabled because it is
  required for compressed snapshot data. Fuse uses its built-in/default
  settings and SDL 2 audio and display paths.
- Internal unit tests: these are a non-interactive developer facility built
  only with Fuse's null UI. `make check` on an interactive-UI build reports
  that a null-UI build is required.

The Emscripten target uses Asyncify because Fuse and the Widget UI retain their
blocking main loop and delay calls. Replacing that loop with a browser-specific
UI architecture is intentionally deferred.
